# Not Just Another C++ Tutorial

## 🏗️🚧 Tutorial is under heavy construction

Things are very much incomplete. Please wait warmly.

### [If you insist, you can start reading anyway.](https://github.com/raviddog/cpp-tutorial/wiki)

## What is this

This project is a zero experience required C++ tutorial. This will not be the most extensive or in-depth tutorial, but is instead targeted at complete beginners, who don't even know where or how to start. My aim is to put you in a position where you can understand what you're reading when you look up how to use a new feature or perform a cool task.

If you find any mistakes or inaccuracies with the content of these tutorials, please let me know. You can raise an issue in Github, or email me, or fix it yourself and submit a pull request, anything goes.

## More details

The tutorial consists of multiple large sections and is designed for one to go through each section before the next. Even if you know what you're doing, it can be helpful to brush up on the earlier topics. However, if you do feel like you don't need the earlier sections, I've done my best to accommodate for that and have provided the required knowledge going into each section.

Each section has a game project that it builds throughout the tutorial. I've seen many tutorials that provide code examples, but no real world use or any idea of how to implement that into an actual project. This is my way of fixing that particular problem. Also making games is cool. You can show it off to your friends. You made this.

### Requirements

- Windows
  - If you're a Linux or Mac user, the setup guides won't be as helpful. However, you can still follow along with the programming tutorials.
- If you're reading this, you have all the other requirements to start.

## Additional Resources

Here are the main learning resources I used when learning how to do this stuff. You can use them in the meantime while I work on this. In fact, you should check them out even when I'm done here, they truly are excellent tutorials. I just feel that some parts could be made more beginner friendly, which is why I'm doing this myself.

- [C++ Tutorial](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/introduction/)
  - This website is also a fantastic reference for C++'s functions. Keep it bookmarked. It's incredibly handy.
- [Lazyfoo.net's SDL2 Game Programming tutorials](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php)
  - Great for moving from console programs to windowed programs
- [Joey DeVries' Modern OpenGL tutorials](https://learnopengl.com/)
  - Modern 3D graphics programming. I'm still working through this one. The amount of content here is unbelievable.
