# Not Just Another C++ Tutorial

## 🏗️🚧 Tutorial is under heavy construction

Please wait warmly.

## What is this

This project aims to be a zero experience required C++ (and gamedev) tutorial. The aim of this tutorial is to be able to teach people all aspects of programming that many higher level languages skip out on, and to be fully accessible to anyone who is willing to learn. And read. There's a lot of reading. Trust me, it's worth it.

This is not the perfect tutorial for everyone, rather it is my attempt to offload the knowledge I've picked up from my short time as a developer, and to fill the perceived shortcomings I have with existing programming tutorials. I won't be able to go over every single feature of C++, because I don't know them. What I can do is put you in a position where you can understand what you're reading when you look up how to use a new feature. If you find any mistakes or inaccuracies with the content of these tutorials, please let me know. You can raise an issue in Github, or email me, or fix it yourself and submit a pull request, anything goes.

While this tutorial is mainly focused on C++ and game development, I hope that even people looking for general programming skills can find it useful.

## More details

The tutorial consists of multiple large sections and is designed for one to go through each section before the next. I do recommend starting from the beginning even if you are coming into this with some existing knowledge. However, if you do feel like you don't need the earlier sections, I've done my best to accommodate for that and have provided the required knowledge going into each section.

Each section has a game project that it builds throughout the tutorial. I've seen many tutorials that provide code examples, but no real world use or any idea of how to implement that into an actual project. This is my way of fixing that particular problem. Also making games is cool. You can show it off to your friends. You made this.

### Requirements

- Windows
  - If you're a Linux user, you're capable of finding this stuff yourself and don't need my tutorial.
  - If you're a Mac user ... I don't have a Mac. Sorry. The setup guides won't mean anything to you but the coding tutorials are still relevant.
- If you're reading this, you have all the other requirements to start.

### Core topics covered

#### Non code

- Setting up a compiler (MinGW-W64, MSVC)
- Make and CMake build systems
- Git (the thing you're reading this on)
- Installing libraries, both manually and with vcpkg

#### Code

- C++ (C++98 and C++11 standards)
- SDL2 library
- OpenGL 3.3
