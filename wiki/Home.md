# Introduction

Welcome to my C++ Programming tutorials. I gather you've already read the Readme on the front page. If you haven't, [please read it now](https://github.com/raviddog/cpp-tutorial). It tells you what you should expect from here.

## Reading these tutorials

The main chunk of these tutorials will be text paragraphs, like this one, and code blocks. The code blocks will look like the following:

```c++
for(int i = 10; i >= 0; i++) {
    printf("%d, ", i);
}
printf("Blast Off!");
```

Important code keywords will be written in a different font, `like this one`.

Additional information or questions are presented in blocks like this one. These are optional, although you may find them useful.
