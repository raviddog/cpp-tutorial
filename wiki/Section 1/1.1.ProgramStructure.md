# 1.1 - General Program Structure

Now it's time to actually begin learning to code. Let's start by seeing what the code to a program actually looks like.

Here's that sample *Hello World* program again. You may create a new file and copy + paste it into your editor if you want.

```c++
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Let's break this down real quickly, and then we can get into the details.

- `#include <cstdio>`
  - This line is an *include* statement. It tells our compiler that we want to use functions from the *cstdio* library.
- `int main() {`
  - This is the opening to our *main* function. A function is simply a block of code, and every program has one called *main*, which is where the program starts.
  - *int* is the return value from our function. Functions can accept and send data back, and this tells us what kind of data will be sent back. Importantly, the main function must return *int*, which the operating system uses to determine if the program closed properly or crashed.
