# 1 - Basic C++

## What's in this section

This section will teach fundamental C++ skills. While not the most glamorous, these skills are vital to writing any sort of useful program, no matter how complicated. The knowledge in this section should be a good platform for you to continue onto more learning more specific concepts, or even moving over to other programming languages.

The section project is a classic text-based guess the number game. Unlike later sections, the project will be entirely done after all the learning pages, since writing any code is hard without these basic skills. It is of course entirely up to you to work on it or skip to the next section, but I've designed it to be good practice for reinforcing the basics.
